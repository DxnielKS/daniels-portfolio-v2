Hey there :)

As you probably already know from the main page, I'm Daniel, it's been a while since i've come out of my comfort zone and put myself out there like this - which is actually the point of this first post.

This marks the beginning of DKS, the stories and documentation of my journey as an engineer with a passion to make cool sh*t and to build things never seen before. There are plenty of specific things I could speak about and say i'm going to be working on, but I think that would be doing a severe disservice to your time! Instead, I can only say that there is a lot of content to come and i'm excited to see your reception to it and get better at creating and building and honing my other talents.

I'll see ya later, peace.
